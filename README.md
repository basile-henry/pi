Pi Approximator
===============

Pi Approximator uses randomness to estimate what the value of pi is. It uses the fact that the probability for a random point inside the square to be also in the circle is equal to pi/4.
It is a very unprecise and slow way to calculate pi, this project goal was mainly to practice html/javascript.
