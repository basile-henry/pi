Pi Approximator
===============

<p>Pi Approximator uses randomness to estimate what the value of pi is. It uses the fact that the probability for a random point inside the square to be also in the circle is equal to pi/4.
<br/>It is a very unprecise and slow way to calculate pi, the project's goal was mainly to practice html/javascript.
